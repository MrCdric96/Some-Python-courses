Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format.
Matplotlib is a Python package used for 2D graphics.

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
# Ploting our canvas
plt.plot([1,2,3],[4,5,1])

# Showing whayt we plotted
plt.show()
"""
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1,2,3],[4,5,1])
plt.show()
